My Andela Bootcamp Final Project (Typing Speed Application)<br>

## Description
* As a users, I can use the application to test my typing speed.
* As a user, when I click on a button, I am given a paragraph which I am supposed to type. Once I submit, the application calculates my typing speed.
* As a user, I can see a leaderboard.

## Extra Credit
* Use firebase to persist data (as a datastore)
